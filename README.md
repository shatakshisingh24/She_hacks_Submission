>>Problem statement:  A-02, Portal for Government schemes. 

## Background:
In India, where a large population is involved in farming-related activities it is very essential to take care of the farmers. State and Central governments release many new schemes, insurance, and loan policies to support farmers and their families. But these schemes do not reach a large part of our country. The farmers who are aware of these schemes enjoy the benefits whereas the small farmers who are unaware and do not know how to access all this information are not benefited. 

##Objective
We are working on a portal that provides easy access to all the schemes released by the Indian government for the farmers.

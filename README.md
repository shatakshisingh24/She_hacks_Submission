*Problem statement:  A-02, Portal for Government schemes.* 

## Background:
In India, where a large population is involved in farming-related activities it is very essential to take care of the farmers. State and Central governments release many new schemes, insurance, and loan policies to support farmers and their families. But these schemes do not reach a large part of our country. The farmers who are aware of these schemes enjoy the benefits whereas the small farmers who are unaware and do not know how to access all this information are not benefited. 


## Highlights:
>> It will have a user-friendly interface as we will design it keeping in mind the view of an average Indian farmer.
>> It will have separate sections for the schemes released by the state government for each state and those by the central government.
>> It will have a feature of text to audio for making it easy for those who can't read.
>> We will try to translate the page in local language depending on location or as per the choice of the user.

## Objective
We are working on a portal that provides easy access to all the schemes released by the Indian government for the farmers. 

We have created a prototype using UI UX Designing. We still have to work on database connectivity and implementation of this portal. Link to prototype is given below.
